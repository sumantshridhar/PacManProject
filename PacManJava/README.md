# Pac-Man Game (Java Swing)

A classic **Pac-Man** game implemented using **Java Swing**, featuring multiple levels, score tracking, sound effects, and a custom HUD.  
This project was developed as part of a college assignment to demonstrate concepts of **OOP, event handling, graphics rendering, and game state management** in Java.

## 🧠 Game Rules & Scoring

### Movement
- Pac-Man moves on a fixed grid.
- Direction changes are allowed **only when aligned to the grid**, similar to the original Pac-Man.

### Scoring
| Item        | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Food pellet |  10    |
| Cherry      |  100   |

- `levelScore` tracks score for the **current level only**
- `totalScore` is updated **only when a level is completed**
- If Pac-Man loses all lives before completing a level, the level score is not added to the total score

---

## 🍒 Cherry Logic

- A **single cherry spawns once per level**
- Cherry appears after reaching **100 points in the current level**
- Spawn position is randomly selected from existing food positions
- Once collected, the cherry does **not respawn** in the same level

## ⌨️ Controls

| Key        | Action |
|------------|--------|
| Arrow Keys / WASD | Move Pac-Man |
| `P`       | Pause / Resume game |
| `M`       | Mute / Unmute sound |
| `ENTER`   | Continue / Restart (context-based) |

---

## 🔊 Audio

- Background music plays during gameplay
- Sound effects for:
  - Eating food
  - Eating cherry
  - Pac-Man death
- Volume controlled using `FloatControl`
- All sounds stop when muted

---

## 🖥️ HUD (Top Panel)

Displays:
- Game title
- Current score (level score)
- Remaining lives (heart icons)
- Current level number
- Mute status icon

HUD is rendered separately using a vertical offset to keep gameplay area clean.
